## Installing ansible in linux server(ubuntu kernel)

* Ansible is an agentless automation tool that you install on a single host (referred to as the control node). From the control node, Ansible can manage an entire fleet of machines and other devices (referred to as managed nodes) remotely with SSH, Powershell remoting, and numerous other transports, all from a simple command-line interface with no databases or daemons required

**_Installing and upgrading Ansible_**

* Locating Python
* Ensuring pip is available

_To verify whether pip is already installed for your preferred Python:_

```cmd
python3 -m pip -V
```
```cmd
sudo apt install -y pip && sudo apt install ansible -y
```

_**install pakages**_


* Use pip in your selected Python environment to install the Ansible package of your choice for the current user:

```cmd
python3 -m pip install --user ansible
```

* Alternately, you can install a specific version of ansible-core in this Python environment:

```cmd
python3 -m pip install --user ansible-core==2.12.3
```
