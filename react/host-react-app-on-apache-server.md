# Host react application on Apache server

### Step 1 : Create your app

```
$ npm install -g create-react-app 
$ create-react-app my-app
```

### Step 2 : Build it for production

```
$ cd my-app
$ npm run build
```

### Step 3 : deploy

- copy and paste everything in build folder to your server
- edit /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf 

```
<Directory "/var/www/html">
    ...
    AllowOverride All
    ...
</Directory>
```

- create a “.htaccess” file in html directory and add this snippet :

```
Options -MultiViews
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^ index.html [QSA,L]
```
or edit /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

```
<Directory "/var/www/html">
    #
    # Possible values for the Options directive are "None", "All",
    # or any combination of:
    #   Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks SymLinksifOwnerMatch ExecCGI MultiViews
    #
    # Note that "MultiViews" must be named *explicitly* --- "Options All"
    # doesn't give it to you.
    #
    # The Options directive is both complicated and important.  Please see
    # http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#options
    # for more information.
    #
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks

    #
    # AllowOverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.
    # It can be "All", "None", or any combination of the keywords:
    #   Options FileInfo AuthConfig Limit
    #
    AllowOverride All

    Options -MultiViews
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule ^ index.html [QSA,L]

    #
    # Controls who can get stuff from this server.
    #
    Require all granted
</Directory>
```
