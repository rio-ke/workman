$$SCP$$
---

SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) is a network protocol used to securely copy files/folders between Linux (Unix) systems on a network.SCP protects your data while copying across an SSH (Secure Shell) connection by encrypting the files and the passwords. 
Therefore, even if the traffic is intercepted, the information is still encrypted.


_**SCP Uses:**_


 * Copying files from a local host to a remote host.
 
 * Copying files from a remote host to a local host.
 
 * Copying files between two remote servers.


_**Syntax**_

```bash

scp <option> source_file_name username@destination_host:destination_folder

```

_**SCP Command Options**_

* -C	Enable compression.
* -d	Copy the file, only if the destination directory already exists.
* -h	Show a list of command options.
* -r	Copy recursively.
* -u	Delete the source file once the copy is complete.
* -v	Enable verbose mode,



_**Copy a File from a Local Host to the Remote Server**_

* Push Method - File is transmitted from `localhost to remote server` 

```bash 

scp /home/source_dir/  username@ip:/home/Destination Dir

```

* Pull Method - File is receive from `remote server to localhost`

```bash

scp remote ip:/home/source_dir/  home/Destination_dir 

```

In this scenario, I'll copy the localhost `backup` folder to the server side.

```bash

scp -r home/Desktop/backup remote ip:/home/remote_dir/

```

_**Copy a File from One Remote Server to Another**_


* Push Method - File is transmitted from `user to remote server`

```
* Pull Method - File is receive from `remote server to user`
 
```bash

scp root@remoteip:/home/source_dir/sample_example.txt username@userip:home/Destination_dir/

```

* If you Ignore Hostkey checking use this option **`-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no`**

```bash

scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no root@remoteip:/home/source_dir/sample_example.txt username@userip:home/Destination_dir/

```
