* **restorecon** is a command in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems that is used to restore file security contexts to their default values. Security contexts are attributes that provide additional information about a file or directory, including SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) context.

* SELinux is a security feature that enhances access controls in the Linux kernel. It assigns security contexts to files, processes, and other system objects. The restorecon command is often used in SELinux-enabled systems to restore the security context of files and directories based on the default SELinux policy.

```cmd
restorecon -Rv /path/to/files
restorecon -Rv /etc/httpd
```
