* Log rotation is a process of managing log files by creating a rotation scheme that limits the size of log files and keeps a specified number of old log files. This helps prevent log files from consuming too much disk space and makes it easier to manage and analyze log data. Here are the steps to set up log rotation:

_Locate Log Rotation Configuration Files_

* On Linux systems, log rotation is typically managed by a tool called logrotate. The configuration files for logrotate are usually located in the /etc/logrotate.d/ directory. Each log file or application may have its own configuration file.
 
_Create a Log Rotation Configuration File_

```cmd
sudo vim /etc/logrotate.d/myapp
```

_Define Log Rotation Settings_

* In the configuration file, define the log rotation settings. Here's a basic example:

```cnf
/var/log/myapp.log {
    rotate 7        # Keep 7 old log files
    daily           # Rotate daily
    missingok       # Don't complain if the log file is missing
    notifempty      # Don't rotate empty log files
    compress        # Compress old log files
}
```

_Test Configuration_

* You can test your configuration without actually rotating the logs by using the following command

```cmd
logrotate -d /etc/logrotate.d/myapp
```

_Run Log Rotation_

* To manually run log rotation for all configured log files, use the following command:
```cmd
sudo logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.conf
```
