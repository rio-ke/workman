## How to Extend/Reduce LVMâ€™s (Logical Volume Management) in Linux

* - [ ] To reduce the size of a mounted folder in LVM and allocate the freed space to a new folder

* `Backup Your Data`: Before making any changes, ensure you have a backup of all the data in the mounted folder. Data loss is possible when resizing filesystems

_Unmount the Filesystem_

```cmd
umount /path/to/mounted_folder
```
_`Resize the Logical Volume`_

- Use the lvresize command to reduce the size of the logical volume. In your case, you want to reduce it from 100 GB to 80 GB

```cmd
lvresize -L -20G /dev/vg_name/lv_name
```

_`Resize the Filesystem`_

- After resizing the logical volume, you must resize the filesystem to match the new size. The command to do this depends on the filesystem type. _`For ext4`_, you can use:

```cmd
resize2fs /dev/vg_name/lv_name
```
_`For-XFS`_

```cmd
xfs_growfs /path/to/mounted_folder
```
