## _keepalived configuration_

* Keepalived is a piece of software which can be used to achieve high availability by assigning two or more nodes a virtual IP and monitoring those nodes, failing over when one goes down. Keepalived can do more, like load balancing and monitoring, but this tutorial focusses on a very simple setup, just IP failove
